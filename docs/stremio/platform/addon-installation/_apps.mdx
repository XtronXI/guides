This is for if you are using the Stremio app on a device such as Android,
Windows, macOS etc.

1. Open the Stremio app and go to the Addons menu.
2. Click the search bar and paste the URL into the search bar. There may also be a `+ Add Addon` button you can click instead, paste the URL there if so.
3. A prompt will appear asking if you want to install the addon. Click `Install`

Some apps do not support manual installation through the app. This includes the Android beta. In this case, what you can do is:

1. Open your browser and paste the URL into the address bar.
2. Replace https:// with stremio://
3. Press enter and the Stremio app should open and prompt you to install the addon.

If it still doesn't work, I'd recommend just using [Stremio Web](https://web.stremio.com/) to install the addon.

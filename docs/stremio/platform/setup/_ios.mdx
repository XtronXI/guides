Stremio can be installed from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/stremio-lite/id6741710156) for iOS / iPadOS.

:::warning
The version of Stremio available on the App Store is a limited version, hence the name "Stremio Lite".

This Lite version cannot stream torrents as it does not include a streaming server. This is due to App Store rules.
However, streaming all other types of media is expected to work, this includes links from debrid services as these are just simple HTTP links.
:::

Once the Stremio app is installed, open it and log in with the account you created earlier.

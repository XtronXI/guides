<h3>Description</h3>

[Torrentio](https://github.com/TheBeastLT/torrentio-scraper) is a torrent search addon that scrapes public trackers. (For a in depth explanation of how Torrentio works, see [this reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/19fmjlp/comment/kjlnwru/))

<h3>Configuration</h3>

To begin, head over to [Torrentio's config page](https://torrentio.strem.fun/configure) to manage the addon.

Torrentio has a lot of options to customise your experience. I will go through each option explaining what it does and list my preferences and why.

![Torrentio Configuration](/img/stremio/torrentio_setup.png)

- `Providers`: These are all checked by default, I recommend leaving it like that. This is to maximise results. You can uncheck foreign providers to remove potential foreign language results, but most will likely also include English audio.
- `Sorting`: By quality then size. If you are not using a debrid service, then do By quality then seeders . This is because without a debrid service you are reliant on the number of seeders. However, with a debrid service the number of seeders is irrelevant to you.
- `Priority foreign language`: Select a language here if you want results with audio in that foreign language to be prioritised. I leave this blank as I do not need to prioritise any foreign language.
- `Exclude qualities`: This option allows you to remove certain qualities from the search results. I exclude _Screener_ and _CAM_ sources. If you have slower internet or your devices aren't capable of playing 4K content, you may want to exclude 4K sources.
- `Max results per quality`: This option will limit the number of results shown for each quality. I leave this blank to obtain all results.
- `Video size limit`: This option will limit the size of the video. If your internet or device is not capable of streaming large files, you may want to set a limit. I leave this blank.
- `Debrid provider`: Choose your Debrid provider if you are using one. If not, skip the rest of the options.
  :::tip
  If you are using more than one debrid provider, you can choose a different provider in the same configuration and when you install the addon, you will get results from each provider you have chosen and given an API key for.

  Torrentio will query the first debrid provider you choose and only if it doesn't find the torrent there will it query the next provider.
  :::

- `API Key`: Click _here_. This link will take you to your debrid provider's website where you can obtain your API key. Copy that and paste it here. (Struggling to find the API key? [click here](/stremio/faq#where-can-i-find-my-debrid-api-key))
- `Debrid options`

  - `Don't show download to debrid`: These links will be displayed with a [.. Download] in front of them.
    These are torrents that were found but not downloaded (cached) to the Debrid's servers.
    Clicking this link sends a request to your Debrid provider to start downloading that torrent.
    Clicking it poses no risk to you. I leave this unchecked.

    Leaving this unchecked is especially recommended when using a debrid service that doesn't have an accurate way of telling what's cached such as Real Debrid.
    As many 'download to debrid' links may actually be playable but not marked as such and you would miss out on those streams.

  - `Don't show debrid catalog`: This will show catalogue(s) containing files that you have previously downloaded with your Debrid provider.
    I check this box as it is unnecessary clutter to me.

Now we are done configuring Torrentio.
The next step is to click `Install`.
Doing so should automatically open Stremio prompting you to install once again.

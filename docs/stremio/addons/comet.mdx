<h3>Description</h3>

[Comet](https://github.com/g0ldyy/comet) is a self hostable torrent/debrid search addon.

One of its distinguishing features is that it supports using Proxy Debrid streams.
This allows the use of Debrid streams on multiple IPs at the same time on the same account.

However, you will have to use comet exclusively, no other addon that uses the same debrid should be being used at the same time as it will have a different IP address to the proxy.

You can read more about its features on the [Comet GitHub page](https://github.com/g0ldyy/comet?tab=readme-ov-file#features)

:::note
The proxy feature is not available on the public ElfHosted instance. You can use the public version with other addons just fine.
It is only if you enable the proxy feature when self hosting (or using a custom ElfHosted instance) that you will have to use Comet exclusively.
:::

Comet can be [selfhosted](https://github.com/g0ldyy/comet?tab=readme-ov-file#self-hosted) or [ElfHosted](https://elfhosted.com/app/comet/).

For this guide, I will go through the setup using the free, public ElfHosted instance. If you don't want to selfhost but want more customisation, you can pay for your own instance on ElfHosted.

<h3>Configuration</h3>

To get started, head over to the [configuration page](https://comet.elfhosted.com/configure)

- **Language Filters**:
  - `Required Languages` - If you absolutely need a specific language, you can set it here. Any results that do not match any of the languages you set here will not be shown. I recommend leaving this blank as many torrents do not specify languages and this may also lead to missing out on many results.
  - `Preferred Languages` - If you only want to prefer results in a language (but not filter out results in other languages), you can set it here. Any results that match any of the languages you set here will be shown first.
  - `Excluded Languages` - If you want to exclude results in a specific language, you can set it here. Any results that match any of the languages you set here will not be shown.
- `Resolutions` - Choose which resolutions you want your results to have. I leave all of them selected to obtain the most results.
- `Max Results Per Resolution` - The maximum number of results to display. I set this to 20 so I don't have as many results to scroll through. You can leave it at 0 to display all results.- `Debrid Service` - Choose your debrid service.
- `Max Size` - The maximum size of the torrent to display. I leave this at 0. If your internet is slow or your device is incapable of streaming large files, you can set a lower maximum size here.
- `Debrid Service` - Select the debrid service you are using here, if any.
- `Debrid API Key` - If you selected your debrid service earlier, provide your API key here. You can find your API key on your debrid provider's website. (Struggling to find your API key? [Click here](/stremio/faq#where-can-i-find-my-debrid-api-key))
- **Advanced Settings**:
  - `Show Cached Only` - When using a debrid service, selecting this will filter out uncached results. I leave this unchecked to see all results. Uncached results can be added to your debrid service and become cached when there aren't any cached results available.
  - `Remove Trash` - This removes all the CAM and Screener sources from the results. It also attempts to remove adult content. I leave this checked.
  - `Result Format` - Choose the information you want to see in the results. I leave all of them selected.

Then either click `Install` to open Stremio with a prompt to install the addon or click `Copy Link` to copy the addon URL to paste into Stremio manually.

# Discord Rich Presence

Want to share what you're watching on Stremio with your friends? There are a couple ways to do this, most being limited to desktop users.

## Stremio Community

**Works On**: Windows
**Requires**: Discord desktop app running on the same device as Stremio.

[Stremio Community](/stremio/extras/stremio-community) is a community version of the desktop Windows client with additional features, including built-in Discord Rich Presence support.
It would replace your current Stremio desktop app.

## Discrakt

**Works on:** All platform
**Requires: ** A Windows, MacOS or Linux device running Discrakt and the Discord desktop app.

[Discrakt](https://github.com/afonsojramos/discrakt) is a bridge between Trakt and Discord that displays what you're watching on Discord.
As it is a bridge between Trakt and Discord, it works with any app that scrobbles to Trakt, including Stremio, from any device/platform.

However, the Discrakt desktop app/server must be running on the same device that Discord is also running on for it to work.
There may also be a short delay before the status updates on Discord as it depends on when Stremio scrobbles to Trakt and when Trakt responds to Stremio.

### Creating a Trakt Application

1. Go to the [Trakt API applications page](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications).
2. Click on `+ New Application`.
3. Fill in the form with the following details:

   - `Name`: Discrakt
   - `Description`: Discrakt is a bridge between Trakt and Discord that displays what you're watching on Discord.
   - `Redirect URI` to `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob`.
   - `Permissions`: Check the `/scrobble` permission.

4. Click on `Save App`

### Setting Up Discrakt

1. Download the `credentials.ini` file and the executable for your platform from the [latest Disckrakt release](https://github.com/afonsojramos/discrakt/releases/latest).
2. Open the `credentials.ini` file in a text editor and fill in the following details:

   - `traktClientId`: The Client ID from the Trakt application you created earlier.
   - `traktUser`: Your Trakt username.
   - `traktClientSecret`: The Client Secret from the Trakt application you created earlier.

3. Make sure the executable and the `credentials.ini` file are in the same folder, and then launch the executable. Make sure Discord is also running.

## PreMiD

**Works On**: Stremio Web
**Requires**: Discord desktop app.

This method requires that you use Stremio Web and have the Discord desktop app installed.

1. Install [PreMiD](https://premid.app/downloads). You can use this [guide](https://docs.premid.app/en/install) to install it if needed.
2. Install the [Stremio Presence](https://premid.app/store/presences/Stremio) presence from the PreMiD store.
3. Open Discord and make sure the `Display current activity as a status message` option is enabled in the Discord settings.
4. Open [Stremio Web](https://web.stremio.com/) and start watching a movie or series.
5. The presence should now show up in Discord.

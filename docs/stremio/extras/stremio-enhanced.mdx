# Stremio Enhanced

[Stremio Enhanced](https://github.com/REVENGE977/stremio-enhanced) is another community version of the Stremio desktop app. It's focused on providing support for
community plugins and themes, and is available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

Some notable plugins that have been made for it include the [Stremio Skip Button](https://github.com/shugi12345/stremio-skip-button). This is a community powered
"Skip Intro" button that allows you to skip intros in TV shows, similar to the feature available on Netflix and other streaming services.

You can find more information about Stremio Enhanced and how to use it on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/REVENGE977/stremio-enhanced). It has its own theme/plugin
browser where you can find and install themes and plugins.
